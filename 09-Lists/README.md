# Lists in Python
A sequence is a datatype that represents a group of elements. A list is very similar
to an array that consist of group of elements.
> The major difference between 'array' & 'list' is that an array can store one type of element
and list can store different type of elements.

**Lists Pattern and their Description**

| Pattern | Description |
| --- | --- |
| clear() | Delete all element from the list |
| reverse() | The sequence of element is reversed in the list |
| sort() | All element in the list is sorted in ascending order |
| pop() | The last element from the list is removed |
| remove() | Remove the specific element from the list |
| count() | Return the number of occurence of specific from the list |
| extend() | Adds the element by 1 in the list |
| copy() | Copy all the list elements to new list |
| insert() | Insert a specific element in the list |
| append() | Appends an element at the end of the list |
| index() | Returns the first occurence of element in the list |
