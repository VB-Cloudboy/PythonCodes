# Tuples in Python
Whenever we want to store a group of elements or items we use tuples. tuples are very similar to list
but the actual difference is tuples are immutable and lists are mutable.
> Impossible to perform operation like append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop() and clear()
> Retrieval and modification of data in tuples are bit difficult. 
- Create a Tuple
- Access a Tuple
- Operate a Tuple

**Types of Function we can process on Tuples**

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sorted(tuple, reverse=false) | Sorts the elements in ascending order |
| sorted(tuple, reverse=true) | Sorts the elements in descending order |
| index() | Returns the first occurence of the element 'x' in tuple and returns erorr if 'x' not found |
| count() | Returns the number of times the element is found in tuple |
| max() | Returns the biggest element in the tuple |
| min() | Returns the smallest element in the tuple |
| len() | Returns the number of element in the tuple |

###### 1. Nested Tuples
```
	Indentation is very important in python.
	The " if " statment id used to identifuy whether the condition is True or False.
	Every condition tested by if statement starts with colon(:)
	After every condition statement there are 4 spaces left in the next line.
	The statements with same indentation belong to same group is called *suite*	
	> 02-Number2Word
	> 03-Suite_Statements
```

###### 2. Addition of an elements in a Tuple 
```
	The if-else statement executes set of statements depending on the boolean state(True/False).
	Again, every condition statement there are 4 spaces left in the next line.
	>04-Even_Odd
	>05-Dhoni_QA
```


###### 3. Modification of an element in a Tuple
```
	If there is a need to test multiple conditions and executes statements based on same conditions.
	we use If-elif-else statements.

###### 4. Deleting an element from a Tuple
