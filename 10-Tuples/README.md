# Tuples in Python
Whenever we want to store a group of elements or items we use tuples. tuples are very similar to list
but the actual difference is tuples are immutable and lists are mutable.
> Impossible to perform operation like append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop() and clear()
> Retrieval and modification of data in tuples are bit difficult. 
- Create a Tuple
- Access a Tuple
- Operate a Tuple

**Types of Function we can process on Tuples**

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sorted(tuple, reverse=false) | Sorts the elements in ascending order |
| sorted(tuple, reverse=true) | Sorts the elements in descending order |
| index() | Returns the first occurence of the element 'x' in tuple and returns erorr if 'x' not found |
| count() | Returns the number of times the element is found in tuple |
| max() | Returns the biggest element in the tuple |
| min() | Returns the smallest element in the tuple |
| len() | Returns the number of element in the tuple |
