	Indentation is very important in python.
	The " if " statment id used to identifuy whether the condition is True or False.
	Every condition tested by if statement starts with colon(:)
	After every condition statement there are 4 spaces left in the next line.
	The statements with same indentation belong to same group is called *suite*	
	> 02-Number2Word
	> 03-Suite_Statements
```
